Same to you.\"\n","\n","He tells me that he loves me, and then I hang up just as I arrive at Wes's house.\n","\n","I park in the driveway next to his bike, not bothering to hide my Jeep down the road like usual. I know all about our past, and frankly, now that Wes knows too, his mother's threats are useless. She can't bully me out of Wes's life.\n","\n","I've made mistakes, not all of them completely my fault, but I can try not to make any more. I'm not sure where we stand relationship-wise, but we'll figure it out. We might even make the right decisions this time. For now, we just have to save the world. No pressure.\n","\n","I quickly dial Nathan, but he doesn't answer, making me nervous. I tell him to call me back, and that I'm at Wes's house. I push the phone into my pocket and climb out of the Jeep.\n","\n","Wes waits for me at his door, smiling and looking a little nervous. I wonder if he thought I was going to turn onto the freeway and drive away instead of coming here. The thought didn't even cross my mind. I would have followed him anywhere.\n","\n","\"Parents aren't home,\" he says, watching my approach. \"In case you were worried.\"\n","\n","\"Now you won't have to lock the door,\" I say, and stop in front of him.\n","\n","Wes's smile fades. \"I always lock the door,\" he replies, and turns to push inside his basement apartment.\n","\n","I realize that I'm nervous too. Beyond the life-altering shit that's about to go down with The Program—I'm here with Wes. And I'm still not entirely sure how to act.\n","\n","I understand what Michael Realm meant now, how remembering can be a curse. Because I remember things that Wes doesn't. I remember how much he loved me. How much I loved him. The stuff they couldn't take. The stuff that crashed back. So much history, and now it's only mine.\n","\n","I walk inside his room and close the door behind me. It's dimly lit, the high-set window not enough on a darkened, stormy day. But Wes doesn't flip on the lights as he leads us into the living room area.\n","\n","I sit on the couch, and Wes comes to the coffee table and turns his laptop in my direction before telling me he'll be right back. He jogs up the stairs and disappears inside his house.\n","\n","I smile at the wallpaper on his computer, a vintage motorcycle, mid-repair. It's simple, honest. I click open the browser, and his last page pulls up. It's a board called Survivor Rate, and the quick description says it's a forum for survivors of the epidemic. It has over ten thousand members.\n","\n","I click on the first thread and start to read through, when I hear Wes close the door and lock it before bounding down the stairs. I look up, and he holds out a bag of frozen peas.\n","\n","\"For your head,\" he says. \"I tried to find an aspirin, but my mom won't keep any pills in the house.\"\n","\n","\"Oh,\" I say, taking the icy bag from him. \"Thank you.\" It's kind of sweet of him to do that without me asking. I move my legs aside as he scoots past me and drops down onto the couch in his usual spot.

One hundred and twenty ASA (I-II) patients were anaesthetized with sevoflurane, isoflurane (1 minimum alveolar anaesthetic concentration [MAC] end-tidal concentration), or fentanyl-diazepam anaesthesia, in combination with 66% nitrous oxide (n = 40 for each group). The evoked electromyogram (EMG) response of the abductor digiti minimi was monitored at 20 sec intervals following train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The initial neuromuscular block was produced by vecuronium 100 micrograms.kg-1. When the amplitude of the first response (T1) had spontaneously recovered to 10% of the control, edrophonium (0, 125, 400, 700 or 1000 micrograms.kg-1; eight patients each) was randomly administered, and the ratio of the fourth TOF to the first response (TOFR) was monitored at one minute intervals for 10 min. Sevoflurane and isoflurane impaired the edrophonium-assisted TOFR recovery in an edrophonium dose and time dependent manner. The dose-response curves at 10 min exhibited a greater shift to the right in the sevoflurane and isoflurane groups than in the fentanyl-diazepam-nitrous oxide group (P < 0.05). Higher ED50 values (the edrophonium dose required to obtain TOFR value of 50%) in the sevoflurane (> 1000 micrograms.kg-1) and isoflurane groups (851 micrograms.kg-1) were observed than in the fentanyl-diazepam-nitrous oxide group (339 micrograms.kg-1) (P < 0.05).

As a critical component of the pseudorandom single photon counter, the photon arriving time digitizer should be storage efficient for a high photon counting rate, while maintaining good time accuracy. We report an ultra storage-efficient time digitizer for a pseudorandom single photon counter in this paper, which is based on the asynchronous serial communication and can store the arriving time of every photon in 1-b memory space. In addition, a novel comb-wave modulator is proposed to achieve the dc balance required for asynchronous serial communication. Our prototype implemented on field-programmable gate arrays provides a time resolution of 400 ps.

We studied angiogenesis in 115 patients with CMD (23 PV, 24 ET, 46 PMF, 12 post-PV and 10 post-ET myelofibrosis) by assessment of microvessel density (MVD) in bone marrow (BM). Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance showed that patients with PMF had significantly higher values of MVD than those with PV (P < 0.001), ET (P < 0.001) and controls (P < 0.001). Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrated that patients with PMF at the prefibrotic stage had significantly higher MVD values than those with ET (P = 0.02). Patients with post-PV myelofibrosis showed significantly higher MVD values than those with PV (P < 0.001), as did patients with post-ET myelofibrosis compared with ET (P < 0.001).

For example, photolithography uses a directed light (radiation) source to transfer a pattern from a photomask (also referred to as a mask or reticle) to a light-sensitive resist material formed on the substrate or material layer, thereby generating an exposure pattern in the resist material. Chemical treatments may then be used to etch or otherwise transfer the exposure pattern in the resist material to the substrate or material layer. More recently, microfabrication has implemented other lithography types, such as charged particle beam lithography, that do not necessitate the intermediary step of creating the mask to transfer or generate an exposure pattern in a resist material. For example, electron beam (e-beam) lithography uses a focused beam of electrons to expose the resist material.

The deep circumflex iliac artery and vein supply approximately the proximal 14 x 10 cm area of this flap. Larger flaps were raised on expanded and control sides of eight pigs to determine if expansion increased the area of survival. In six of eight pigs whose initial tissue expansion did not create more than approximately a 50% increase in skin area, the expanded flaps had a statistically significant increase in viable skin area (proportionally) 10 days post inset than their control flaps (p less than 0.05). Two other pigs did not conform to this pattern. Their initial tissue expansion was greater than 50%, and the resulting area of flap viability was proportionally less in expanded flaps than the control flaps.<|endoftext|>Q:\n","\n","Question about recommendation letter\n","\n","I am applying my MA program in October, there is a professor agree to write a recommendation letter for me.

For example, will the royalty rate run any higher than it might have in the past to make up for the lack of advance?

How are you ensuring good-faith with the selected writers?\n","\n","Mike: Yes, that's a fair assumption, about the draft Intro. Ideally we'd ask for more but it doesn't seem fair to ask people for more when it's entirely possible that we'll receive 200-300 proposals and will only be able to publish 15-20 of them.

Visuospatial and constructional skills in developmental reading disability.\n","Cognitive models for developmental dyslexia are nowadays centered on the hypothesis of a specific deficit within the phonologic module of the language system. To ascertain whether defects of spatial cognition are associated with developmental reading disability, we investigated a sample of 43 school children (aged 8-9 years) found to be reading impaired during a wide screening survey for developmental dyslexia in the province of Naples, Italy. After one year all children were tested again and only 9/43 still presented reading impairment, while the remaining had achieved a variable range of spontaneous recovery. A detailed analysis was performed on all children to characterize their cognitive performances using on one hand classical conventional tests for constructional praxis, visuospatial cognition, and visuospatial memory and on the other a specific neuropsychological battery for constructional disorders. The results of our study demonstrated that children with long-lasting reading impairment exhibited normal performances on spatial cognition tasks. Moreover, one single child was found with relevant visuospatial deficits pointing to the possible existence of a visuospatial subtype for developmental dyslexia.<|endoftext|>Venice, Day 2\n","\n","We had spend a lot of time people watching and gelato eating in Piazza San Marco, but this morning we decided to head up the Campanile Bell Tower (thankfully there was\n","    \"\"\"\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"m-RePlDutkmU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["snippets_4_912 = [\n","    r\"\"\"\n","    Conclusion\n","==========\n","\n","Phenformin significantly inhibited both the development and growth of established MCF7 and MDAMB231 tumours without murine toxicity.

It was established by Grycak for non-conformally flat pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n\\ge 5$ [@Grycak]. In $n=4$ it holds for Lorentzian manifolds (Eriksson and Senovilla [@Eriksson]). In $n\\ge 5$, by the above equivalence, conformal semi-symmetry implies Ricci semi-symmetry, $[\\nabla_i,\\nabla_j]R_{kl}=0$. A summation over cyclic permutations of indices $ijk$ gives the algebraic property (Defever and Deszcz [@Defever]): $$R_{im} R_{jkl}{}^m +R_{jm} R_{kil}{}^m +R_{km} R_{ijl}{}^m =0. \\label{eq2.1RR}$$ This equation originally appeared in Roter’s paper on conformally symmetric spaces ([@Rot72] lemma 1). In ref. [@ManMol2012] the property was generalized by us, to define the notion of K-compatible tensor, where $K$ is Riemann’s or Weyl’s or a generalized curvature tensor (then eq. states that the Ricci tensor is Riemann compatible). Geometric implications of compatibility were explored for the Riemann tensor [@RCT] and the Weyl tensor [@WCT]. In particular we showed that Weyl and Riemann compatibility are equivalent for the Ricci tensor. Manifolds whose Ricci tensor is Weyl compatible are termed “Weyl compatible manifolds” [@ManSuh2014]. Several such manifolds, which include the Robertson-Walker space-time, were discussed by Deszcz et al. [@Deszcz2013]; another example is Gödel’s metric ([@Deszcz2014], th.2).\\\n","In this paper we present new results on (CR)$_n$ manifolds with dimension $n\\ge 5$. In Section 2 we specialize the second Bianchi identity for the Weyl tensor and an identity by Lovelock to algebraic ones, and show that in $n\\ge 5 $ the tensor $\\alpha_i\\alpha_j$ is Weyl compatible; also the Ricci tensor is such, when $\\alpha $ is closed. The Weyl tensor is represented as a Kulkarni-Nomizu product in terms of the recurrence vector $\\alpha_i$ and the symmetric tensor $E_{il}= C_{ijkl}\\alpha^j\\alpha^k/\\alpha^2 $.\\\n","In Section 3 we introduce the tensor $h_{ij}=C_i{}^{klm}C_{jklm}/C^2$. Among other properties, we show that it is covariantly constant, $\\nabla_k h_{ij}=0$. Therefore, this tensor gives an explicit realization of Gricak’s theorem [@Grycak1981], namely that the traceless part of the Ricci tensor is proportional to the traceless part of $h_{ij}$ via a scalar function, eq.. This means that, up to a scalar function, the traceless part of the Ricci tensor is determined by the Weyl tensor. Proportionality implies unicity of $h_{ij}$ and that the Ricci tensor cannot have more than 2 eigenvalues, and that the recurrence vector is an eigenvector.\\\n","In Sections 4 and 5 we focus on Lorentzian (CR)$_n$ manifolds, $n\\ge 5$: the existence of $h_{ij}$ with null covariant derivative implies that a (CR)$_n$ Lorentzian manifold is either decomposable or it admits a unique null covariantly constant vector field [@Senovilla; @Hall91]. If $C^2\\neq 0$ the manifold is decomposable. A Brinkmann or pp-wave metric requires $C^2=0$, with the characterization given by Galaev [@Galaev].\\\n","With null recurrence vector $\\alpha^2=0$, the algebraic type of the Weyl tensor is at least II$_d$ in the high-dimensional Bel-Debever-Ortaggio classification [@Ortaggio09]. This extends the result of Mc Lenaghan and Leroy [@LenaghLer] valid in $n=4$. If $\\alpha^2 < 0$, Weyl’s tensor is purely electric, according to the definition given in [@HeOrWy2013].\\\n","In Section 6 we construct a simple example of (CR)$_n$ manifold.\n","\n","We assume that the manifolds are smooth, connected, Hausdorff, with non-degenerate metric ($n$-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifolds) and that $\\nabla_j g_{kl} = 0$.
